Module 1 Summary
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know: 

Cloning the template and using a proper naming convention for the repository ensure the starter code is available and the repository is easy to identify. 

When your repository is publicly viewable, anyone can view it and provide helpful feedback. 

A well-crafted user story template helps you standardize the workflow and ensure that stories are complete. 

User stories are vital for Agile development and help streamline the process from planning to deployment. 

Prioritizing user stories is imperative to know which stories take precedence and which ones you can revisit in a later sprint. 

With custom labels like “technical debt,” you can describe, filter, and search your stories more quickly and easily. 

A story point is a measure of a story’s effort, complexity, and uncertainty — all factors that impact how long the story will take to complete. 

A properly designed sprint plan helps everyone understand what you have done, what you still need to do, and how likely you are to reach your sprint goals.
